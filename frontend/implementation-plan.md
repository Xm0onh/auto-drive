# Frontend Implementation Plan for Autonomys Network Data Upload

## Overview

Create a simple web application that allows users to upload files, which are then chunked, submitted to the blockchain, and stored in a database with CID indexing.

## Tech Stack

-   Frontend: React.js with TypeScript
-   Backend: Node.js with Express (see backend/src/server.ts)
-   Database: sqllite
-   Blockchain Interaction: Polkadot.js API -> via transactionManager service (already implemented in backend/src/services/transactionManager)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set up the Project Structure

1. Create a new React project using Typescript
2. see "backend/" for backend setup including database

### 2. Implement the Frontend UI

1. Create a simple form with a file input and upload button
2. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for file upload
3. Add a progress bar to show upload status
4. Display upload history with CIDs and status
5. Ability to download files from the network via CID

### 3. Integrate Existing Backend API Endpoints

1. See "backend/" for backend setup including database

### 4. Integrate File Chunking Service

1. See "backend/" for backend setup including chunking service

### 5. Integrate Blockchain Submission

1. See "backend/" for backend setup including transactionManager service

### 6. Integrate Database

1. see "backend/" for backend setup including database

### 7. Connect Frontend to Backend

1. Implement file upload functionality using axios
2. Create a service to poll upload status from the backend
3. Fetch and display upload history from the backend

### 8. Implement Error Handling and Logging

1. Add error handling for file uploads, chunking, and blockchain submissions
2. Implement logging for important events and errors
3. Display user-friendly error messages in the UI

### 9. Optimize Performance

1. Implement client-side chunk hashing to reduce server load
2. Add support for resumable uploads
3. Implement caching for frequently accessed data

### 10. Testing and Refinement

1. Write unit tests for critical functions
2. Perform end-to-end testing of the entire upload process
3. Optimize based on performance metrics and user feedback
