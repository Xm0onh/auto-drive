# Data Access Layer Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines the initial implementation of a data access layer for the Autonomys Network. The project will focus on creating a system that listens for `system.remark` extrinsics, hashes the data, and stores it in a key-value pair structure. This implementation will serve as a foundation for future integration with the Distributed Storage Network (DSN) and support for large file handling. This will be implemented in typescript with a preference for functional style programming and prefer yarn for package management. The Autonomys Network is built on substrate.

## Components

### 1. Extrinsic Listener

-   Implement a listener for `system.remark` extrinsics on the Autonomys Network chain
-   Extract the data payload from each `system.remark` extrinsic

### 2. Data Hasher

-   Create a function to hash the extracted data
-   Use a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to generate a unique identifier for each piece of data

### 3. Key-Value Store

-   Implement a key-value store to save the hashed data
-   Use the generated hash as the key and the original data as the value

### 4. API Interface

-   Develop a simple API to interact with the key-value store
-   Implement methods for storing and retrieving data

## Future Enhancements (Placeholders)

### 5. DSN Integration

-   [TODO] Replace the key-value store with DSN addressing
-   [TODO] Implement functions to store and retrieve data from the DSN using the generated hash

### 6. Large File Handling

-   [TODO] Implement a system to break large files into smaller chunks
-   [TODO] Create a metadata structure to keep track of file chunks
-   [TODO] Develop functions to reassemble chunked files upon retrieval

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up a project structure with necessary dependencies
2. Implement the Extrinsic Listener
3. Develop the Data Hasher function
4. Create the Key-Value Store
5. Build the API Interface
6. Write unit tests for each component
7. Integrate components and perform system testing
8. Document the API and usage instructions

## API Endpoints (Initial Version)

1. `POST /store`

    - Request body: `{ "data": "string" }`
    - Response: `{ "hash": "string" }`

2. `GET /retrieve/{hash}`
    - Response: `{ "data": "string" }`

## Next Steps

-   Implement the basic functionality as described in this spec
-   Test the system with various data inputs
-   Plan for DSN integration and large file handling features
-   Develop a roadmap for scaling and optimizing the data access layer
